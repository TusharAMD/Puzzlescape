# What it does
Test your brain skills with slide puzzle games. Instead of collecting and finding traditional puzzle pieces, test your skills with the difficult format of puzzle gaming.

 The puzzle is fixed in a frame and only one piece can be moved at a time. And when you move a piece, it also changes the position of the others, which makes it more challenging than a traditional puzzle.
 
 One of the hardest parts of solving a sliding puzzle is preventing future moves from ruining previous slides. There is nothing more frustrating than having to move a new tile in a way that messes up all that you have done before. 
 
 To prevent this, try to think ahead and consider what will happen several moves in the future each time you slide a tile.

# Features:

**Timer:** It also has a timer which makes your hype higher to solve the puzzle as quickly as you can. After the timer ends the puzzle automatically closes.

**Background Music:** By listening to the music the nature of the game allows a more immersive experience than film.
